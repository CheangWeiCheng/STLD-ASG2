## Additional Credits
The scripts PlayerBehaviour.cs, CoinBehaviour.cs, HealthBehaviour.cs and BridgeMovementBehaviour.cs were modified from what was provided by my lecturer, Mr Justin Lee.  
Deepseek AI was used at times to optimise the code and fix certain errors. However, it was not used to write the code entirely.
