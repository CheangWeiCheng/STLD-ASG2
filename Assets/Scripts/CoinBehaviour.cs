* Description: This script handles the behaviour of collectable coins in the game.
* When a player collects a coin, it plays a sound, updates the player's score, and destroys the coin object.
* The coin can be highlighted when the player is near it, and it has a value that contributes to the player's score.
* The script also ensures that the coin can only be collected once to prevent double collection.
